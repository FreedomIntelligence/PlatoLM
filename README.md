# ReaLM
Welcome to our Realm.

We propose a new paradigm training a user simulator `UserGPT` to generate multi-round conversations. When using this paradigm to fine-tune LLAMA-7B-2, the performance of the resulting model  `ReaLM` surpass LLaMA-2-7B-chat and Vicuna with only 50.7K samples in MT-Bench.
