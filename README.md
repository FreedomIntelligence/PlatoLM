# ⚡ Introduction
Welcome to our realm:hugs:

We propose a new paradigm for training a user simulator. 

After applying this paradigm to ShareGPT and LLaMA-7B, a novel user simulator, `UserGPT`, emerged. Through iterative interactions between UserGPT and gpt-3.5-turbo, a multi-round conversation dataset named `RealChat` was generated. Leveraging this dataset for fine-tuning LLAMA-7B-2 resulted in the `ReaLM` model, which exhibits superior performance compared to LLaMA-2-7B-chat and Vicuna in MT-Bench. Impressively, this improvement was achieved using a modest 50.7K samples.

The dataset was dubbed `RealChat` due to its human-like user side. UserGPT's versatility in switching between raising novel questions and incorporating single-round dialogs as conversational instructions to create domain-specific datasets led to the naming of the answering model as `ReaLM`.

# 📚 Methodology
The key to our idea is to `flip the chessboard`.

We just mask the questions of real users and accordingly, only calculate their loss for the purpose of modifying the learning objective.
In addition, we use a dyadic prompt template to instruct our backbone.

The main difference between us and other research is shown below.
