# ‚ö° Introduction
Welcome to our realm:hugs:

We propose a new paradigm for training a user simulator. 

After applying this paradigm to ShareGPT and LLaMA-7B, a novel user simulator, `UserGPT`, emerged. Through iterative interactions between UserGPT and gpt-3.5-turbo, a multi-round conversation dataset named `RealChat` was generated. Leveraging this dataset for fine-tuning LLAMA-7B-2 resulted in the `ReaLM` model, which exhibits superior performance compared to LLaMA-2-7B-chat and Vicuna in MT-Bench. Impressively, this improvement was achieved using a modest 50.7K samples.

The dataset was dubbed `RealChat` due to its human-like user side. UserGPT's versatility in switching between raising novel questions and incorporating single-round dialogs as conversational instructions to create domain-specific datasets led to the naming of the answering model as `ReaLM`.

# :book: Methodology
The key to our idea is to `flip the chessboard` (:chess_pawn:from an AVG ‚Äî‚Äî „ÅÜ„Åø„Å≠„Åì„ÅÆ„Å™„ÅèÈ†É„Å´).

We just `mask the questions of real users` and accordingly, only `calculate their loss` for the purpose of `modifying the learning objective`.
In addition, we use `a dyadic prompt template` to instruct our backbone.

The main difference between us and other research is shown below.

```
# üßê Inferencing
```shell
# To infer ReaLM, you can use the following command
python -m model.sft_realm.source.deploy.cli --model FreedomIntelligence/ReaLM-7b
# To infer UserGPT, you can use the following command
