# ‚ö° Introduction
Welcome to our realm:hugs:

We propose a new paradigm for training a user simulator. 

After applying this paradigm to ShareGPT and LLaMA-7B, a novel user simulator, `Socratic`, emerged. Through iterative interactions between Socratic and gpt-3.5-turbo, a multi-round conversation dataset named `SocraticChat` was generated. Leveraging this dataset for fine-tuning LLAMA-7B-2 resulted in the `PlatoLM` model, which exhibits superior performance compared to LLaMA-2-7B-chat and Vicuna in MT-Bench and Alpaca-Eval. Impressively, this improvement was achieved using only 50.7K samples.

~~The dataset was dubbed `RealChat` due to its human-like user side. Socratic's versatility in switching between raising novel questions and incorporating single-round dialogs as conversational instructions to create domain-specific datasets led to the naming of the answering model as `ReaLM`.~~

# :book: Methodology
The key to our idea is to `flip the chessboard`.

We just `mask the questions of real users` and accordingly, only `calculate their loss` for the purpose of `modifying the learning objective`.
In addition, we use `a dyadic prompt template` to instruct our backbone.

The main difference between us and other research is shown below.

# üöÄ Training
```shell
# To fine-tune Socratic, you can use the following command
bash model/sft_socratic/scripts/sft_socratic_7b.sh
# To fine-tune PlatoLM, you can use the following command
bash model/sft_platolm/scripts/sft_platolm_7b.sh
```
# üßê Inferencing
```shell
# To infer PlatoLM, you can use the following command
python -m model.sft_platolm.source.deploy.cli --model FreedomIntelligence/PlatoLM-7b
# To infer Socratic, you can use the following command
# The model's weights of Socratic has not been published yet. 
python -m model.sft_socratic.source.deploy.cli --model balabala
```
